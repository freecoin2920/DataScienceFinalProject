##Discriptive Analysis

```{r Ex-1}

#Ex-2 OCED members in unemployment (Was the NetExports affected by the unemplyment rates in OCED countries? 1. we have to filter the OCED countires in unemplyment 2. Using a Graph check how netexports was affected.

#We built a ML model on a training dataset and estimate the feature importance on the test dataset while keeping priority to the most important variables, iterate through by building models of given subset sizes, that is, subgroups of most important predictors determined from step 1. Ranking of the predictors is recalculated in each iteration and show the model performances are compared across different subset sizes to arrive at the optimal number and list of final predictors.
